> **This is a fork of [niri](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri) with one addition: a BeOS-style title tab above each window.**
>
> Everything else is unmodified upstream niri: the same config, the same IPC, the same version numbers, the same `niri` binary name. The fork is rebased onto each upstream release and tagged `vXX.YY-beos.N`.
>
> Niri deliberately draws no window decorations, and a title tab is one, so this lives here rather than as an upstream pull request. We're grateful to the niri authors for the compositor this is built on. **Please report anything unrelated to the title tab upstream**, and title-tab issues here.
>
> The tab is **on by default**. To get stock niri rendering, add this to your config:
>
> ```kdl
> layout {
>     title-tab {
>         off
>     }
> }
> ```
>
> The only other changed default is the accent: the focus ring's active color is BeOS yellow (`#ffcb00`) instead of niri's light blue, so the tab, which takes its color from the focus ring, looks right out of the box. Your own `active-color` or theming tool overrides it as usual.
>
> What the tab does: shows the window title, click to focus, drag to move, a close button before the title and a maximize (zoom) button after it. Tabbed columns show a row of tabs instead of niri's side indicator. The tab comes filled in the frame color, or as an outline joined to the focus ring (`style "outline"`). See [Configuration: Title Tab](docs/wiki/Configuration:-Title-Tab.md) for every option, and [deploy/install.md](deploy/install.md) for running the fork alongside stock niri.

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never "overflow" onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there's always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Workspaces.html) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Window-Rules.html#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Screencasting.html#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Tabs.html)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Layout.html#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Background blur](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Window-Effects.html) for windows and layer-shell surfaces
- [Animations](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config
- Works with [screen readers](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Accessibility.html)

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html) page.
Grab a desktop shell like [DankMaterialShell] or [Noctalia] (or build a more traditional setup): niri by itself is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out [awesome-niri], a list of niri-related links and projects.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol's page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I've seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: [integrated](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite) via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.

## Contributing

If you'd like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell's global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- Hyprland has a built-in [scrolling layout](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Scrolling-Layout/).
- [Paneru] and [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.
